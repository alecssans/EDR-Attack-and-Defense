# Project
This lab simulates real-world cyber attacks and endpoint detection/response. Following Eric Capuano's guide, Iâ€™ll use VMs to replicate threat and victim machines. The attacker machine will run Sliver as a C2 framework to target a Windows endpoint protected by LimaCharlie (EDR).

# Setup
Machines:

Attacker: Ubuntu Server with Sliver installed as the C2 framework.

Endpoint: Windows 11 with Microsoft Defender disabled (and other settings adjusted).

Tools:

Sliver: Primary attack tool on the Ubuntu machine.

LimaCharlie: EDR solution on the Windows machine, with a sensor linked to the endpoint and Sysmon logs imported for monitoring.

# Attack
I generate a payload using Sliver and implant it onto the Windows host. Once the malware is executed on the endpoint, a command-and-control (C2) session can be established.
With a live C2 session established, the attacker can now explore the target machine, check privileges, gather host information, and assess the security measures in place.
